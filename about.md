Hi! I'm Jessica! I'm currently a rising junior at Carnegie Mellon studying Computer Science.
I enjoy doing ML research, with an interest in generalization,
generative models, and understanding models and their architecture!
I also like to travel to places to learn about culture; my more recent adventures have
been to Qatar and Ethiopia.
I also like tea a bit too much.

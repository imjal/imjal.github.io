This loop was a 40 mile trail with 8000ft in elevation gain. The peak of the trail is at Glen Pass, which is at 11,926â€², just shy of a 12k. Will and I got altitude sickness after reaching 9k, but the views and opportunities to take photos were just awesome. Especially the second day, I got some of the best landscape shots I've taken so far! If anyone is thinking about going on this trail, I really recommend spending your zero day at Dragon Lake trail. You get a nice view of Rae Lakes from the top of the range, hike an Enchantments like cairn full trail (and get lost), and see a beautiful remote alpine lake. May is probably not the best time to do this trail, as the pass still has considerably snow on it. However, most of the rocky side had melted, so we were able to ascend up switchbanks on the left side of the pass, before we crossed the final snowfield that brings you to the top of the pass. Definitely nervewracking doing things that were on the border between requiring snow skills and not, but we made it. Thank you to the guy who helped us routefind and led the way!
